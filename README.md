# Exploratory Data Analysis: First project

### This repository contains plots in png format and R files for corresponding plots. This project is part of the coursera course,  Exploratory Data Analysis.
### This assignment had used data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: “Individual household electric power consumption Data ### Set”.


## Description of data and variables
* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns, but I had only used data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02.
* Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.
* Date in format dd/mm/yyyy.
* time in format hh:mm:ss.
* Global_active_power in kilowatts.
* Global_reactive_powerin kilowatts.
* Voltage in volt.
* Global_intensity is the household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere).
* Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2,Sub_metering_3 are in watt-hour,corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner. 

## Description of plots 
* Plots are in png format with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Each plot have its different source code (_plot.R, plot2.R etc_).
